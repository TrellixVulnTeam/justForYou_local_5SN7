     <h1>Policies & Procedures</h1>
        <div class="well">
            <p>
                Our program is open to children from infant to school age. We
                are open Monday - Friday, 6:45am - 5:30pm all year round.
            </p>

            <p>
                Late fees apply after 5:30pm @ $1.00 per minute paid to the
                Early Childhood Educator waiting with your child.
            </p>

            <p>
                It is recommended that children not be in care for more than 9
                hrs per day.
            </p>

            <p>
                Parents must sign children in and out every day. If there is an
                emergency evacuation, we will take the sign in/out book when
                leaving the centre. This will be an important tool to make sure all
                children are accounted for and, in the case of other emergencies,
                we will know by whom and at what time the child was picked up
                and dropped off. As well as signing your child out, make sure an
                educator is aware that you are leaving with your child.
            </p>

            <p>
                If someone other than a parent is dropping off or picking up your
                child, it is necessary for you to call and tell us whom and at what
                time.
            </p>

            <p>
                If another person is picking up your child and is not recognized
                by the educator that is present, they will be asked to present
                photo identification and will be required to sign your child out.
            </p>

            <p>
                We encourage you to establish a routine pick-up as it helps the
                children establish their daily routines. If you are going to be late,
                please call us so we can prepare your child for a later departure.
            </p>


            <p>
                Please call to tell us when your child will be absent; we wait
                for each child’s arrival and are concerned when they do not
                arrive.
            </p>

            <p>
                Within the centre’s legal rights, children will not be released
                into a situation in which the educator believes the child is in
                danger. This includes release to persons suspected to be under
                the influence of intoxicating substances, without the presence
                of a sober driver or the lack of appropriate seating in a vehicle.
                In the event of extreme circumstances in which a child is
                placed in danger, the centre has a legal and ethical
                responsibility to report persons to the appropriate authorities.
